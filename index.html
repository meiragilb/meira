    <p>Hi! I'm Meira, a PhD Student at the University of Washington's Information School studying digital privacy.</p>
    <p>I am interested in how technology, particularly social media platforms, fosters new forms of interpersonal, “social” surveillance between peers. Specifically, I am interested in questions such as:

<ul>
<li>How and why do people monitor, surveil, and disclose information about others?</li>
<li>What are the risks of these practices?</li>
</ul>

<p>To address the first question, I use qualitative HCI methods to analyze user behaviors, perceptions, and reactions to social surveillance practices. To address the second, I rely on work from usable privacy & security to conduct risk assessments of these technologies, and surveillance studies to critically address how these practices engage with identity and power. </p>

<p>Before I started my PhD, I worked on Meta's privacy incident management team and recieved my Bachelor's in Information Science from Cornell University.
</p>

<p> When I'm not researching privacy, I love to read, spend time outside, and hang out with my two cats, Scallion and Pancake.</p>
